## About The App

This is going to be a desktop app for a dungeons and dragons character sheet. Characters and stats will be stored and if I'm feeling spicy, I'll also have a search function that hits the DnD API and can fetch rules, monsters, spells, etc.



## About wails

This is the official Wails React-TS template.

You can configure the project by editing `wails.json`. More information about the project settings can be found
here: https://wails.io/docs/reference/project-config

## Live Development

To run in live development mode, run `wails dev` in the project directory. This will run a Vite development
server that will provide very fast hot reload of your frontend changes. If you want to develop in a browser
and have access to your Go methods, there is also a dev server that runs on http://localhost:34115. Connect
to this in your browser, and you can call your Go code from devtools.

## Building

To build a redistributable, production mode package, use `wails build`.
